# Super-Resolution for Mobile and Web using ONNX Runtime

Implementing Super Resolution functions on Images using ONNX Runtime


### Why use ONNX models

The [Open Neural Network Exchange](http://onnx.ai/) (ONNX) is an open standard for representing machine learning models. The biggest advantage of ONNX is that it allows interoperability across different open source AI frameworks, which itself offers more flexibility for AI frameworks adoption.

### Why use ONNX Runtime

[ONNX Runtime](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/) is a cross-platform machine-learning model accelerator, with a flexible interface to integrate hardware-specific libraries. ONNX Runtime can be used with models from PyTorch, Tensorflow/Keras, TFLite, scikit-learn, and other frameworks.
